        <h1 class="main-news">Breaking News! Emmett named player of the month</h1>
        <h3 class="description-news">Emmett has been awarded Player of the Month for November, showcasing his
             impressive talent as a 10th grader in his first year on the varsity soccer team. As a starting center back,
              he quickly established himself as a key player, contributing significantly to the Eagles’ overall success this season.<br><br>
              Coaches and teammates praise Emmett for his strong defensive skills and leadership qualities. Coach King, when describing Emmett, 
              said that he “played hard and never gave up the ball.” This recognition is well-deserved, and the Onteora Eagles are proud of Emmett's
               achievements, looking forward to his continued growth in the coming seasons. Congratulations, Emmett!<br><br>
                    While Emmett’s recognition is well-earned, there’s been some friendly banter among teammates
                about how his twin brother, Roy, also had a strong case for the award. Roy, a striker, had a sudden explosion of form toward the end of the season,
                 scoring multiple header goals and proving to be a major threat in the attacking third. Both brothers have contributed so much to the team’s 
                 success this season, and their hard work and teamwork remain a big part of the Eagles’ success! </h3>
